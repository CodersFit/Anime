      <div class="intro3">The stories tell of four heroes summoned from another world – the sword, spear, bow, and shield heroes who will prevent calamity. With darkness bearing down on them, the Kingdom of Melromarc summons these heroes from modern day Japan.

      <div class="intro7">Mushoku Tensei is a relatively new anime that aired recently in January of  2021, and it is one of the most beautifully animated Isekai anime of all time. This one follows the story of a 34-year-old man who used to lead a pretty miserable life.  One day, he dies because of an accident and gets reincarnated as a baby in a fantasy world. Now, his name is Rudeus Greyrat, and he has been given a second chance at life.<br>Watch the trailer below!!!<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DTfgyQU-CDw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
      <div class="anime8">Grimgar: Ashes and Illusions</div>
      <div class="image8"><img src="https://nefariousreviews.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/grimgar-ashes-and-illusions-featured.jpg?w=672&h=372&crop=1"/></div>
      <div class="intro8">Grimgar is basically the opposite of Overlord.We have a wide main cast where everyone is equally important, none of them have their previous memories or can metagame, and none of them are overpowered. In fact, they all kind of suck at what they do. However, that’s the beauty of the show. As we get to see a group of people grow up in an RPG world, struggling constantly but never giving up.They were basically left for dead by the other players and now it’s do or die. The show’s pacing might be a little slower than what you would expect from an isekai. But it only helps to further enthrall you into the world.<br>Watch the trailer below!!!<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aR0UcWq_JrY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
      <div class="anime9">The Devil is a Part-Timer!</div>
      <div class="image9"><img src="https://img.hulu.com/user/v3/artwork/8534ee83-b681-4dbc-bad9-b9a1d3f08483?base_image_bucket_name=image_manager&base_image=621be1b3-1656-482b-b029-c9aabf29f191&size=1200x630&format=jpeg"/></div>
      <div class="intro9">The Devil is a Part-Timer can be seen as the reverse isekai. This is because in isekai shows a person from the “normal” world gets transported into a video game or a fantasy world. However this time around, literal Satan, his right-hand man, and fabled heroes get transported into modern day Japan. Their magic is basically non-existent. And they soon have to face their strongest foe yet: capitalism and the minimum wage. The show is a comedy and delivers on that front continuously from episode to episode, so I highly recommend giving it a watch if you haven’t already.<br>Watch the trailer below!!!<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9eCFxxQ4WE0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

      <div class="intro12">The world of Hunter x Hunter is dangerous. At any moment, any character could make a poor decision or run into the wrong character, and wind up very, very dead. This is a world where, more often than not, even the main character is struggling to avoid being killed by vastly more powerful opponents, creating a constant sense of tension even when they’re in the midst of a grand adventure. <br>Watch the trailer below!!!<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d6kBeJjTGnY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

      <div class="intro22">Edward and Alphonse Elric’s journey to recover their bodies after a mistaken attempt to bring their mother back to life using alchemy is definitely one of the most captivating stories in anime.

      <div class="intro32">Though Dragon Ball Z isn’t the first shonen anime ever, it’s definitely the most influential.

      <div class="intro62">Bleach is considered one of the "big three" in shonen anime alongside Naruto and One Piece. Out of the three, Bleach is the only one that isn't still airing or doesn't have a spin-off still ongoing. However, that doesn't mean the show was bad.

On the contrary, it is still very popular and there have been other projects made such as a live-action film since it ended. The main character, Ichigo Kurosaki, is a high school student who becomes a Soul Reaper with the job of protecting people from malevolent spirits known as Hollows.<br>Watch the trailer below!!!<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oZ67d9XSjFs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

      <div class="intro72">Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.[Written by MAL Rewrite].<br>Watch the trailer below!!!<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LHTYpWI3S6Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
